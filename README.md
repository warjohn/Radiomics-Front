<p align="center"> Description.
    <br> This is a test version of an application for the automatic calculation of radiomics features. The application is designed to automate the processing of medical data, extraction of radiomic features from medical images, and further analysis. The project is currently under development, and some features may be unavailable or require further improvement.

## üéâ Project Structure <a name = "Project_Structure"></a>

The project consists of two main parts:

- *Frontend*: The user interface for interacting with the application.
- *[Backend](https://github.com/warjohn/Radiomcis-Backend)*: The server-side logic for data processing and management.


## üèÅ Current Status <a name = "Current_Status"></a>

The project is at an early stage of development. At this point, basic functionalities are implemented, including:

#### <p>1) Importing and processing medical images.
#### <p>2) Extracting radiomic features.
#### <p>3) Basic API functionality for data interaction.

### What works:

- Image processing.
- Extraction of basic radiomic features.
- API for data management.


### What is still in development:

- Advanced radiomic feature processing algorithms.
- Improved user interface.
- Support for additional data formats.
